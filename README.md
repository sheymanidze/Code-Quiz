## Comments

 One of the desired functions I would like to incorporate later is the option to delete only current score saved in local storage instead of deleting entire saved information. Also, since quiz was build based on the homework example, I decided not to include buttons “next” after each question, or progress bar with correct answers and questions left. Personally, it was more challenging to do it without “next” button option. Overall, all quiz was built slowly in terms of time but with clear understanding about every single line, function, structure and etc. Everything that was used in current project can be easily applied in the future outside the school.
